              International Carriage is governed by the Convention, where
              applicable, or under applicable laws where the Convention does not
              apply. Where your travel is wholly within Australia with no
              international sectors, it is subject to the provisions of the
              Civil Aviation (Carriersâ€™ Liability) Act 1959 as amended (or any
              replacement legislation), the Australian Consumer Law or in the
              case of intra-State travel, complementary State legislation.
